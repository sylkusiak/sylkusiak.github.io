    <!-- About Me: Full Bio -->

<section class="sylwia_bio_page">
  <p class="bio_text">
My journey from a farmland to the big city taught me how to adapt quickly and always with an eager, positive attitude. I have adapted to a variety of different roles during my professional journey.

Before becoming a UX Designer, I studied Intercultural Communications and Studio Art at DePaul University. My dream was to become a social worker, travel the world, and learn about the many different ways that people communicate and shape their identity. After college, I decided to become an educator. I spent a few years workings as an educator for various high schools across the city of Chicago. I was able to develop and lead Art + Design curricula for creative students within schools that were under resourced and didn’t always have the resources for art-based classes. I loved making that happen and inspiring young students to not give up on their creative passions and skills.<br><br>

As much as I loved teaching, I still felt like I had a lot to learn and experience. I decided to transition into the contemporary art world. I worked closely alongside several contemporary artists, gallerists and curators as a project manager. My studies in art history flourished as I learned how to adapt to the fast-paced, high-value world of the contemporary art market. It was here where I developed strong communication skills and learned that confidence and a strong presentation is everything when it comes to selling. How else do you think these art dealers are able to sell a tiny painting for half a million bucks?!<br><br>

Using the sales strategies I picked up in the art world, I leaped into yet another industry -- the tech world. And I never looked back. I was fascinated by the innovation happening within the tech industry, so I decided to begin my journey in tech as a Sales Representative at a start-up company. I was able to colloborate and learn from leaders in Product, Engineering, Revenue and even Marketing. I quickly realized that strong collaboration amongst these different departments resulted in a stronger, more informed digital product.<br><br>

Long story short, I began my studies in UX Design while I was working full time as a Sales Representative. It was stressful at times, but I never missed a beat in my performance at work. My incredible colleagues supported me by participating in my research and by simply cheering me on to the finish line because they knew I had the business grit, passion, and creative eye to become a kick-*ss UX designer!<br><br>

Outside of work, you can find me taking longs walks on the beach with my rescued Pitbull pup named Moo Moo. With her fuzzy white fur, giant black spots, soft pink ears and gentle personality -- she reminds me of the cows my family had back on our little farm in Poland.  More importantly, Moo Moo alerts me when I’ve been staring at the computer screen for too long. She’s taught me that quick breaks within nature are crucial for mental health and focus! You should try it sometime. </p>
