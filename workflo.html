      <div class="overview">
      <h2 class="blue">The Overview </h2>
        <p class="intro_subtitle">Cloud storage platforms have transformed the way we organize and sync our files. Physical cabinets full of folders and documents have been quickly replaced by the power of the digital cloud --- allowing users to carry their content with them on any device, practically anywhere.
          Beyond file syncing, cloud-based platforms have also changed the way that users collaborate in academic and professional settings. There has been an upward trend in people working remotely. Over the last 5 years, there has been a 44% increase in remote working within the U.S.</p>
      </div>

         <div class="problem_objective">
          <h2 class="blue">The Problem </h2>
            <p class="intro_subtitle">Collaboration is difficult for users with different schedules and responsiblities. Communication breakdowns often occur within teams at work. This results in ongoing disorganization, delays in productivity, potential loss of revenue, and <strong>stress</strong>.</p>
              <h2 class="blue"> The Objective </h2>
                <p class="intro_subtitle">Enhance the way teams of all sizes collaborate digitally. </p>

          When conducting a competitive analysis of the cloud storage market, it was clear that price and efficiency were main concerns for companies, especially start-up companies with tight budgets.
          I found that many customers preferred Google Drive because the product was intuitive and the most affordable for teams of various sizes. Dropbox was the most expensive; however, the collaboration features on Dropbox for Business were more robust.  Teams can create, chat, and comment within a “smart” workspace while integrating with several other products within the Dropbox platform.  Microsoft Teams was also a more affordable option for businesses and offered excellent collaboration tools, specifically within the Microsoft Suite. Rather than relying on integrations, Microsoft Teams allowed users to keep track of all content (chat, email, calendar and tasks) in one seamless plaform.

    <div class="body_text">
    <p class="blue"> To begin, I created a remote user survey and distributed it to 50 participants spanning across various professions. Roughly 83% of users rely on cloud-based platforms for work with team members and clients.
    I conducted 1 on 1 interviews with working professionals to get a better understanding of their role at work, management strategies, day to day work routines, and the current digital tools that they used at work to collaborate.</p>
    <p><br>Ease of collaboration among team members was a prevalent issue within my research. Users stated that it was difficult to “keep folders organized as a team.” Many expressed frustration with current platforms, stating that the “infrastructure was confusing” and that “people process it differently which then leads to lapses in communication.”
    <br><br> It was clear that lack of consistency and disorganization were major pain points.</p>

Our brand identity highlights the beauty of diverse teams with a focus on celebrating talented professionals, at varying stages in their career journeys. The SaaS (software-as-a-service) business model would allow flexiblity in pricing plans which would make the platform more accessible for all types of budgets.</p>

  <p class="subtitle">I applied feedback from the usability testing and used the style guide to refine and finalize the high-fidelity designs.
I was able to further expand the user flows through detailed UI elements with an attention to UI micro-interactions. Users would have more guidance through these interactive elements. For example, as you can see in the prototype below, an admin user would be alerted when a task was overdue and with just one click, the team member would be recieve a notification to complete the task. Not only would this save time and prevent lapses in communication, but the platform would be fun and intuitive for all. </p>

  <div class="body_text">
  <p class="subtitle_white">There is more that can be developed and improved within the cloud collaboration market. Especially since companies have recently adapted to the new normal of "work from home" settings. If I had worked with a larger product team, we would be able to expand on each feature to further improve the user experience of our target customer. I hope to continue exploring more automated ways to improve collaboration in virtual work settings, specifically through the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am also particularly interested in interviewing more administrative roles across different industries. I want to better understand different management styles to further customize and streamline a virtual project management experience, while making the experience fun and enjoyable. </p>
